# Health-Care-Analysis
The goal of this project is to bring notions of Computational Probability and Statistics from theory to practice on healthcare settings. Through the analysis of patient information such as demographics, billing behavior, as well as medical test result, this study illustrates how methods of statistics and graphics can reveal patterns and varia tions in the data, and can model the dependence between medical information and the cost.
# Abstract
This was an assignment as part of the subject/academic course Computational Probability and Statistics to analyse a synthetic healthcare dataset from kaggle. This data set contains 55,500 patient records as a result of 1,500 patients each described by 37 attributes. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used, complemented with multiple visualization methods, to identify patterns within demographics, billing, and medical tests. The relationship between patient days and charges was also investigated.
# Key Findings
Dataset includes 55,500 patient records with 15 attributes (age, gender, condition, billing, test results, etc.).
Average patient age ≈ 52 years.
Mean billing amount ≈ $25,500.
Diagnostic test outcomes are nearly evenly split among Normal, Abnormal, and Inconclusive.
Statistical measures (mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness, coefficient of variation) highlight variation in patient age and billing.
Visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatter plots, regression plots, box plots) effectively show data patterns and outliers.
A weak positive correlation exists between admission duration and billing amounts.
